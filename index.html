					<h1>(Re-)Shaping your Data</h1>

					<p>Instructional Technologist <br/>(FAS Academic Technology)<br/><a href="mailto:atg@fas.harvard.edu">atg@fas.harvard.edu</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hello, I'm Jeremy Guillette. I'm an instructional technologist with
						Academic Technology for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences here at
						Harvard, so it's my job to help faculty and students use technology
						in research and teaching.

					<aside class="notes">
						I've worked with quite a few historians, and often, if a historian
						wants to do the kind of large scale analysis that requires some
						kind of statistics, their data isn't a friendly modern data source,
						it's a messy paper document like this one, a list of passengers
						sailing from Barbados in 1919. When this data was collected, any
						analysis you could perform would be very manual. If you wanted to
						know how many people were recorded as "male" in this document,
						you'd have to count them. If you wanted the average age, you'd have
						to calculate that manually. And if you want to calculate the
						average ages of men and women in this document, be prepared for
						more manual math.

						This makes the work of pioneers like W.E.B. Dubois all the more

						Part of the equation is still a lot of elbow grease in
						transcribing data into a spreadsheet form. But the reason to go
						through the trouble is that once the data is electronic and
						structured, it becomes much more flexible, so you can ask more
						sophisticated questions of a given data source.

					<h1 style="font-size:120pt;">PIVOT TABLE</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The tool that I want to add to your toolbox today is called a pivot
						table. I've written it very large and given it its own slide,
						because I want you to remember what this tool is called, so even if
						you forget how it works, you can easily look it up later.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<style>table#example tr :nth-of-type(3) { background-color: #dad; }</style>
					<table id="example">
						<tr><th>Place</th><th>Slave/Free State</th><th>Turnout</th><th>Year</th></tr>
						<tr><td>Alabama</td><td>Slave</td><td>49.1</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Connecticut</td><td>Free</td><td>14.9</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Illinois</td><td>Free</td><td>24.3</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Indiana</td><td>Free</td><td>37.1</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Kentucky</td><td>Slave</td><td>25.4</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Maine</td><td>Free</td><td>19.1</td><td>1824</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Maryland</td><td>Slave</td><td>53.7</td><td>1824</td></tr>
					</table>
					<aside class="notes">
						Take this sample data. We have a good structure here, with each row
						representing a single point of data and telling us about it. We
						have turnout percentages, and the other columns answer questions
						about those data points. Where was that turnout observed? When was
						it observed?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Easy: </strong>What was the turnout in Alabama in 1824?</p>
					<p><strong>Hard: </strong>What was the average turnout for slave states in each year recorded?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are different questions that you might want to ask of this
						data, some of which will be more difficult to answer than others
						from just looking at the data. You can find the data point to
						answer the first question, but to find the average turnout for
						states with legal slavery as of the start of the civil war, it
						seems like you'd need to do a lot of math. Or, you can use a pivot
						table. I'll show you how it works in Google Sheets.

					<aside class="notes">
						Under Data, you'll find "Pivot table...". This creates a new blank
						sheet with some additional options. I can set the rows to years,
						the columns to slave state / free state, and the values to Turnout,
						and then change how they're summarized from SUM to AVERAGE. Then
						I'll change the display of the values to "Number". So what I've
						created is a new spreadsheet, with the unique values for years as
						rows and the unique values for slave vs. free state for columns,
						and then tell the spreadsheet to take all of the values at the
						intersections of those conditions and summarize them as an average.
						So whatever data we have in our initial spreadsheet for free states
						in 1824, the pivot table has found all of those values and combined
						them into an average. and then done the same for all of the other
						combinations shown.

				<section>
					<img src="img/turnout.png" alt="chart representing pivot table">
					<aside class="notes">
						With the data in a pivot table, you can then make a chart like you
						would normally in Google Sheets that highlights broader trends,
						like how you can see the lasting influence of confederate states on
						voter turnout in this line chart.

					<h1 style="font-size:120pt;">PIVOT TABLE</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hopefully I've convinced you that a pivot table is something that
						can help you with spreadsheet data, so I'm writing it in giant
						letters again.

						Pivot tables are great, but there are other ways that you can make
						spreadsheet data work for you with other tools, whether they're
						scripts in python or R, specialized programs like OpenRefine, or
						weird little internet tools like Mister Data Converter.
