# Pivot Table lightning talk slides

These are the slides for a lightning talk on pivot tables that I've given a
couple of times at Unabridged. It's a very short introduction to thinking
differently about data in spreadsheets. It uses
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) as a presentation framework.
